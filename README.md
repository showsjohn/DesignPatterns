This project implements the Observer Pattern and Factory Pattern

```EventFactory``` implements the Factory Pattern.
```CalendarDayPanel``` and ```EvenListPanel``` together implement the Observer pattern through the ```CalendarDayListener``` interface. When a CalendarDayPanel is clicked on, the information in that panel is sent to the EventListPanel and the appropriate data for that particular date is displayed

To fellow reviewers, this project is still WIP. The patterns are mostly in place, but I have recreated the project from the beginning and not all the original functionality is in the project yet.
